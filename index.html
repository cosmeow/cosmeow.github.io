    <p style="margin:30px;padding-top:20px;">Not always the case.  My current problem is:  I think my previous plan was crap.  I'm going to have to try something totally different if I have to finish this all by yesterday.</p>
    <p>11-18-2018:  Discovered I can actually come up with quite a few plans.  They aren't crap, but I do admit that there always seems to be a way to talk
        one of out a plan if one is determined too.  I did get my 'current plan' to work and it doesn't seem to be total crap.  It was mainly crap because it wasn't a project I wasn't interested in, but has to be done.</p>
